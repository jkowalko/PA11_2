# What drives the Price of a Car ?
#Practical Project II, Mod 11

## Summary
This project predicts used car prices and identifies key drivers using linear regression models, following the CRISP-DM framework. The dataset, containing 426,880 used car listings, was cleaned to handle missing values, outliers, and skewed variables. Key findings include:
- **Key Drivers**: Car age, mileage, manufacturer, vehicle type, and condition significantly influence prices.
- **Model Performance**: Lasso regression performed best, with the lowest RMSE and highest RÂ², indicating good predictive power.
- **Findings**: Newer cars, lower mileage, and brands like Toyota command higher prices. SUVs and pickups are also more expensive.
- **Recommendations based on Findings**: Buyers will prioritize newer, low-mileage cars while sellers can highlight these features to maximize value.
